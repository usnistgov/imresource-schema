  <description>The International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM) is intended as a common reference for all those working in metrology, the science of measurement and its application. It is a guidance document published by the Joint Committee of Guides in Metrology (JCGM), which comprises eight member organizations: BIPM, IEC, IFCC, ILAC, ISO, IUPAC, IUPAP, and OIML. The official document is now in its 3rd edition, often referred to "VIM3".

This web version of the VIM also contains a number of informative annotations added by JCGM Working Group 2.</description>
